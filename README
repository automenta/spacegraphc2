SpaceGraph-C v2.0
-----------------

Code:
	bullet-src/ & bullet-gl/
		These are exact copies of the Bullet-2.7 physics engine 'src' and 'Demos/OpenGL' directories...
		...except that the BulletMultiThreaded/GpuSoftBodySolvers directory was removed when it didn't compile as-is under Ubuntu linux.
		(A more careful cross-platform facility may not require it's removal in the future.)

		The purpose being that when new bullet versions are released, they can be dropped-in.

	src/
		The SpaceGraph rendering environment and control systems.

	The Makefile was generated from NetBeans 6.9 and the NetBeans project files are included for immediate opening.
